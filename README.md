# GroupProject1: Breaking Dad

## Description
Our application is a fun app to start your day off on the right foot. Bringing together quotations from the popular TV series Breaking Bad and the classic comfort of Dad Jokes, you can generate one or the other to suit your mood. Once you click the button that corresponds to which you would rather receive, our app will display what you've asked for and also tally how many times you pick each option. The question to ask yourself now is are you the one who knocks, or would you rather hear a knock knock?
